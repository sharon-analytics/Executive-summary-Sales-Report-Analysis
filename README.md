## Project Overview  
💼 This project presents a high-level executive summary of sales performance across geographies, products, and sales teams. The goal is to uncover insights about profitability 📈, sales trends across regions 🌍, team and product performance 📋, and customer engagement levels 👥. This analysis helps identify top performers, understand geographic strengths, and inform future sales strategies.

---

## Tools Used  
- **Power BI**: Used exclusively for data cleaning, modeling, analysis, and dashboard creation.  

---

## Data Cleaning/Preparation  
Data preparation was done directly in Power BI with the following steps:

✅ Merged all four tables using proper relationships (e.g., matching `Product`, `Geo`, and `Sales Person` across tables).  
✅ Calculated `Total Sales`, `Total Cost`, and `Total Profit` using DAX measures.  
✅ Created custom metrics like `Profit %` and `Sales per Customer`.  
✅ Verified team and product category consistency using reference tables.  
✅ Standardized data types (e.g., date formatting, numeric precision).  
✅ Added calculated columns where necessary (e.g., Profit = Amount - Cost).

## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)  
This phase aimed to answer the following:

- Who are the top-performing salespeople in terms of profit margin?  
- Which geographic region generates the highest total sales?  
- How do product categories perform across regions?  
- What is the average number of sales per customer?  
- Are there patterns across teams (Delish, Juicies, Yummies)?

## Recommendations  
🏅 **Incentivize Top Sales Reps**:  
  - Leverage high-performing reps like Gigi Bohling and Jan Morforth in mentorship or leadership roles.  

🌍 **Geo-Targeted Strategy**:  
  - Focus sales campaigns more heavily in the UK and New Zealand where ROI is highest.  

📊 **Team Insights**:  
  - Perform deeper team-level analysis to identify what sets "Yummies" apart if they dominate the leaderboard.  

📦 **Product Optimization**:  
  - Cross-analyze cost vs. volume per product to detect high-margin opportunities.  
  - Expand promotion for high-demand items in low-performing regions (like Canada).  

📈 **Customer Upsell Potential**:  
  - Encourage upsells through loyalty campaigns or product bundles to boost average sales per customer from 25 to 30+.
